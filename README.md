🦋 Flag Capture Game with Login, Leaderboard & Timer ⏳🎮
🎯 Overview
This is a fun and interactive butterfly-themed flag capture game where players log in, catch flags, and compete for the highest score! It includes user authentication, real-time scoring, and a leaderboard system — all built using simple data structures like dictionaries or JSON files.

Flags appear randomly on the screen. Capturing each flag earns 50 points.

Players have just one minute to capture as many flags as possible.

Once all flags are captured, a new batch of flags is automatically generated.

🛑 Game Over & Restart
When time runs out, a "Game Over" banner appears, and players can press 'R' to restart the game.

🏆 Leaderboard
After logging in, players can click the "Leaderboard" button to view real-time scores of all users sorted from highest to lowest.
